# Visualizing Sorting Algorithms with C++ and SDL

Sorting techniques are cool! well they can be..What's cool about
arranging numbers in certain pre-defined order? Well because seeing
a chaotic mess arranged neatly is kind of an eye candy. 

Here's my attempt at visualizing some sorting algorithms and how
they work internally. Hope they give you an intuitive idea of how
they actually work!

## Demo
Quick demo of Quick Sort:

![Quick-Sort](https://github.com/SuprimDevkota/SDL-Projects/blob/main/Visualizing-Sorting-Algorithms/gifs/quicksort.gif)



## Included Algorithms
```
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
```



## Dependencies
SDL2 (if you need help with adding extension libraries to Visual Studio: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/06_extension_libraries_and_loading_other_image_formats/windows/msvc2019/index.php)
## Roadmap

- Better design patterns

- Sound effects
