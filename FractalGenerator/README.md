# FractalGenerators with C++ and SDL2


## Demo
Quick demo of a Julia set with c = -0.8 + 0.156j and the famous Mandelbrot set

![Julia-set](https://github.com/SuprimDevkota/SDL-Projects/tree/main/FractalGenerator/gifs)<br>
P.S-the inversion in b/w while zooming in is due to overflow of the long doubles min and max BUT i still think it looks cool!!<br>
